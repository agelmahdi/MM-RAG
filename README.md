# ðŸ§  Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System

## Overview

**Multimodal RAG** combines the power of **vision** and **language** models to deliver intelligent, context-aware responses.  
Our system integrates **image understanding**, **information retrieval**, and **text generation** to handle fashion-related queries effectively.

### What Is Multimodal RAG?

- **Multimodal:** The system works with multiple data types â€” both **images** (e.g., fashion photos) and **text** (e.g., descriptions, prices, metadata).
- **Retrieval-Augmented:** Before generating a response, the system **retrieves** relevant information from a structured database to ensure factual accuracy and context.
- **Generation:** Using the retrieved information, a **Large Language Model (LLM)** generates detailed, context-rich responses.

## ðŸ§© Pipeline Overview

### 1. Multimodal Input Processing
- Users upload fashion images.
- The system processes and converts each image into a **vector representation** using a vision encoder.
- These vectors capture essential **visual features** of the fashion items (e.g., style, color, texture).

### 2. Vector-Based Retrieval
- The image vector is compared against a **database of pre-encoded fashion images**.
- **Cosine similarity** is used to find the most visually similar items in the vector space.
- Relevant structured data â€” such as **item details, prices, and product links** â€” is retrieved from the matched entries.

### 3. Context-Enhanced Generation
- The retrieved fashion data is formatted into structured prompts for the **Llama 3.2 Vision Instruct** model.
- The LLM combines insights from:
  - The **uploaded image**, and
  - The **retrieved database context**.
- This results in **comprehensive, detailed, and accurate** responses â€” far beyond what could be achieved from the image alone.

## ðŸš€ Key Benefits

- **Improved accuracy:** Retrieval ensures responses are grounded in real data.  
- **Context awareness:** Combines visual and textual context for deeper understanding.  
- **Scalable architecture:** Works with large fashion datasets using vector search.  
- **Enhanced user experience:** Provides rich, descriptive, and personalized fashion insights.
